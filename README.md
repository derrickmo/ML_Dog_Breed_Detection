Libraries: TensorFlow 2.0 with Keras, and TensorFlow Hub

Kaggle competition details: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/description

1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog

2. Data
Data are downloaded from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/description

3. Evaluation
The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

4. Features
Deal with unstructured data (images) so this model will be using deep learning / transfer learning.
Multi-class classification: 120 breeds (categories)
Training Set: 10,000+ images
Test Set: 10,000+ images
